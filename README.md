# Cisd Markov

In this project I'll be testing the effectiveness of the ICT concept change in state of delivery.

My hypothesis is that CISD candles will be more likely to have their high ran above. So the candle that makes the bullish orderblock in this example.


##### Variables I'm looking to investigate;
What % will that high be ran above in the 1st candle after, 2nd candle after.

Does the OB size matter? eg. how many consecutive downclose candles?

Does OB wick being closed above matter?

### Results
OB wick getting closed above matters

In the significance, a basic CISD faired worse compared to a bullish candle getting its wick closed above. My theory on this is momentum would skew results. Either way CISD shows its significance once you take wick closures into account
