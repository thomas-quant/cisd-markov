Just a statistical significance test

My methodology was basically the aidenomics pdh pdl closure thing. So if yesterday got closed above by today, the probability of tomorrow and the day after running todays high. except on the 1hr timeframe


Bullish events: 4237
Runs within next 2 bars: 3316/4237 = 78.26%

Bearish events: 3429
Runs within next 2 bars: 2511/3429 = 73.23%
